# DBABnch

Not much here yet.  I use this as a DBA with a lazy mentality.  Most of my stuff has migrated from SQL scripts in a hodge-podge of folders to a SQL Server Solution with a hodge-podge of folders and nested-folders, and projects under those.

I've started creating (one) SQL Server Template(s) to speed some work, and a large number of SQL Prompt Snippets.

# BUT

I'm a programmer (old word, I know), and I want a WinForms program to do the work instead of me editing SQLCMD SETVAR values, highlighting portions of SQL and running - oops - rerunning.
I run things in haphazardly remembered sequences, and then variants pop up and I spin off down tangents (like this one.)  

## Permissioning

All DBAs do permissioning.  Badly.  We all believe we each do it the best, most pragmatic, efficient, realistic way.  And we do it manually.  Ugh.

A better system would be to take the user inputs, transform them into real system values (instead of their best-guess), and search for intersects of relativity (misuse!) already there, and then see where a new relation can fix their problem.
